# Numpy-Pandas-Training
A simply repository to familiarize myself with Mathematical Modules in Python for use in ML.

Go to Numpy/ to find 6 Jupyter Notebook Files explaining Numpy. \
Go to SciPy/ to find 9 Jupyter Notebook Files explaining SciPy. \
Go to Matplotlib/ to find 12 Jupyter Notebook Files explaining Matplotlib. 

CAT-1 going on, will include Pandas after 2nd April.
